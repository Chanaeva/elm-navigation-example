#elm-navigation-example

to start the app run:
```
npm install
npm start
```
This example uses pathname parsing instead of hash parsing because I really don't like having hashes in my URLs.

If it doesn't work properly for any reason, let me know and feel free to make a pull request for any improvements you can think of, preferably in the direction of simplicity.
